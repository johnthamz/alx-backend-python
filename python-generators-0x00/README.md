# Python Generators â€“ 0x00

This script connects to a MySQL database, creates a table, loads data from a CSV file, and streams data using Python generators.

## Files

- `seed.py`: Contains all logic to:
  - Connect to database
  - Create tables
  - Insert data from CSV
  - Stream data using a generator

## Usage

3. Run the script from a terminal or Jupyter notebook.
4. Call `stream_users(connection)` to yield one user at a time.
